    <h2>Origin of the Term "Weblog"</h2>
    <p>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997.</p>

    <h2>Origin of the Term "Blog"</h2>
    <p>The short form "blog" was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase "we blog" in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.</p>

    <h2>Popularization of the Terms</h2>
    <p>Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb, meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog." He also devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.</p>
